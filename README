Including:

WARNING: I tried to replace filetypes.vim with that from this package, but in version 6.4
It won't run and it completely disable all filetype autodetections... So if you have lower version
than 7 please excuse me, you must extend your autodetection In filetypes yourself,
If someone have done it, please send it to me, i will include, if not, I will do that as soon as possible
